Sixth assignment:

Create a HighscoreRepository interface, which should be a JpaRepository<Highscore,Integer>
Make sure it's detected and created by spring as a @Repository.
For simplicity we're going to expose the data to the world by annotating the interface with @RestResource

If you have done this correctly (and restarted your server),
the repository should be accessible as a REST endpoint, which can be tested in the (included in the project) browser:
http://localhost:8080/api/browser/index.html#http://localhost:8080/api/highscores
